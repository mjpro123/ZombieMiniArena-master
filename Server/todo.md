All Old Zma recipes, weopons, ect. 
Well, first of all WELCOME TO ZOMBIE-MINI ARENA!!! 🎉 🎉 🎉 
Whether you just want to play casually, or practice your 1v1 skills, or afk overnight, this will teach you some things about ZMA.

Orange Gems: Orange gems are obtained at every 10 kills, just kill people in forest! Orange gems are used to buy some special items at the right side of the map. You can also use an orange gem to enter the dragon cave! The entrance is at bottom middle. It is recommended that you first get a luck crown to increase your taming chances. You can then tame a baby dragon at the cave! (Beware of the dragons and players o.o, also 3 orange gems = 1 bottle).

Bottles: Obtained at every 20 kills, bottles are used to save your life assuming you can drink/craft the bottle fast enough.

Super scubas: you need to mine 6969 emeralds in order to obtain it...hehe. You can also trade 2500 flies at the shop at top right.

Flower hat: Obtained by surviving for 150-in game days (allows you to enter flower hat afk, you're pretty much unkillable there).

The Lava Biome is a way to challenge yourself with both lava and players trying to kill you. At the end there's a chance you can receive a random lava item, or a redite helmet or sword. You can also break/glitch through the wood spike to get a redite kit, with many building materials to make a base. 

Go to the desert for aloe, or to get to wood for spikes. Or you can just try flying around the sky looking for other players to fight.

Big winter: you can farm winter mobs.

Firefly shop: Getting enough Fireflies will allow you to trade Fireflies for gear, 2.5k flies for a super scuba, 7.5k fireflies for a diamond sword, 7.5k flies for a hawk 10k flies for a blue crown, (allows you to farm kills)! 1k flies for a blue gem (which will be explained down below), and 7.5k fireflies for a diamond helmet.

Base locations: You can build bases at lava biome, top middle lava, aswell as the winter spot located bottom left of forest down a hallway, you can farm materials at both bottom left winter, and top lava which you can use to make a reidite spike doors (great for bases) You may not build bases in essential spots such as gem exchange, firefly shop, forest, gambling area, and Big winter. 

Afk locations:** You may afk at the middle left arena, bottle area, or flower hat. (Keep in mind, it is allowed to kill ground and flying afks at the middle left arena, so make sure to check up on your token often)! 
Blue gems: blue gems are obtained at every 100 kills, or trading 1k fireflies at the Firefly shop, with blue gems you can get things like Amethyst gear, and full midas! (Check ⁠📝・zma-gearlog  for details) 

Generators: You can get death/life wands through chests which spawn randomly in forest, they generate fireflies. 
This is just what ZMA holds, and hopefully this was helpful and I hope you enjoy zma (beware of scripters o.o)
